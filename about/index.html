              Art Box was created by Avand Amiri and Santiago Palacio. They met at a Halloween event
              but only got a chance to speak briefly. For about a year, they made efforts to try and
              see each other but it didn't work. Finally, Avand invited Santiago over for a small
              gathering with a few close friends but, after a long day at the river, none of the friends
              showed. Instead, Santiago and Avand got to connect over a couple bottles of champagne. It
              was over that champagne that they became friends, brothers, and business partners.

              Santiago Palacio is a printmaker, poet and painter currently working in Yosemite National Park.
              Originally from South America, Santiago currently lives in a rustic cabin in the park where he
              spends eight months of the year devoted to public service. Through his art as well as his work
              he aims to inspire people to fall in love with one of the greatest American legacies: the wild
              and public lands of the National Parks. Santiago's art is featured in some of the Art Boxes
              in Mariposa. He works closely with local artists to curate the art that goes into the boxes and
              helps run the operations of Art Box.
