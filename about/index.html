          Art Box was created by Avand Amiri and Santiago Palacio. They met at a Halloween party
          but only got a chance to speak briefly. For about a year, they tried to connect but schedules
          wouldn’t have it. Finally, Avand invited Santiago over for a small gathering with some close
          friends and even though no one else showed, Santiago did. They got to talking over champagne,
          became friends, brothers, and, with Art Box, business partners.

          Santiago Palacio is a printmaker, poet and painter currently working in Yosemite National Park.
          Originally from South America, Santiago currently lives in a rustic cabin in the park where he
          spends eight months of the year devoted to public service. Through his art as well as his work
          he aims to inspire people to fall in love with one of the greatest American legacies: the wild
          and public lands of the National Parks. Santiago's art is featured in some of the Art Boxes
          in Mariposa. He works closely with local artists to curate the art that goes into the boxes and
          helps run the operations of Art Box.

          Avand is a technologist and Airbnb Superhost based out of Mariposa. He came to Mariposa
          from the Bay Area and now proudly calls the mountains his home. Having spent 20 years
          writing software, Avand handles the technical side of Art Box, including the website,
          the checkout process, and the QR code system. Avand understands scaling businesses and
          how technology plays a role.

          Avand loves supporting the local community. His Airbnbs consistently provide income to
          Mariposans and have done so for years. His property is also home to Yosemite Movement Arts, a
          aerial silks studio run by Carissa McKee, who has this to say about Avand:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          As I navigated my journey as a performance artist & entrepreneur in Mariposa, few people
          have been as supportive as Avand. We spent time brainstorming and dreaming together and he
          has had a direct influence in bringing some of my dreams to fruition. Thanks to Avand, I
          now have the privilege to run a space where I can share my art and joy with the community.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Avand is an artist himself and grew up surrounded by art. His mother,
          <a href="https://amirifinearts.com" target="_blank">Fahimeh Amiri</a>,
          is a renowned Utah-based artist and art teacher. She illustrated
          <a href="https://amirifinearts.com/#/illustrations/" target="_blank">three children’s books</a>,
          while she raised Avand and, today, offers children’s art classes from her Park City-based
          studio. Fahimeh repeatedly organized exhibits for her students at the Salt Lake City Public
          Library. The importance of showcasing artwork is not lost on Avand and is in some ways
          an impetus for Art Box.
