              An artist and an Airbnb Superhost walk into a bar... ü•Å
            </p>

            <p>
              All kidding aside, that‚Äôs not far off from <a href="../about">how Art Box was born</a>.
              A local Mariposa artist, Santiago Palacio, and a local vacation rental host and technologist,
              Avand Amiri, got to talking about ways to promote local artists. ‚ÄùGuests always comment on
              the little touches in my listings like the rhyming labels or the local cider,‚Äù Avand noted.
              Offering art work seemed like a no-brainer.
            </p>

            <p>
              An Art Box is a curated collection of local art that vacation rental hosts can offer to their
              guests to browse and shop. Like a collection of vinyl records, guests can admire art, scan a
              QR code to buy, and take home the art they love.
            </p>

              <strong>Benefits</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              Having an Art Box in your listing is a great way to:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Support local artists</li>
              <li>Differentiate your property</li>
              <li>Improve your reviews</li>
              <li>Stand out as a host</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              There‚Äôs no cost or effort on your part. We‚Äôll deliver the Art Box to your property and replace it
              when inventory gets low. We‚Äôll also deal with theft and returns.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Art Box is designed to blend in to any style property. As a humble crate, it won‚Äôt compete
              for attention with your decor. It‚Äôs designed to reward curiousity and as such there‚Äôs minimal
              marketing material. Guests browse the art, like they would a crate of vinyl records, self-checkout
              using a QR code on the back of each piece, and take home the art they buy.
            </p>
