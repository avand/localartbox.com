              An artist and an Airbnb Superhost walk into a bar...
            </p>

            <p>
              All kidding aside, that’s not far off from how Art Box was born. A local Mariposa artist
              and Airbnb host got to talking about ways to promote local artists. ”Guests always comment
              on the little touches in my listings like the rhyming labels or the local cider I provide,”
              the Airbnb host noted.
            </p>

            <p>
              Having an Art Box in your listing is a great way to:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Support local artists</li>
              <li>Differentiate your property</li>
              <li>Improve your reviews</li>
              <li>Stand out as a host</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              There’s no cost or effort on your part. We’ll deliver the Art Box to your property and replace it
              when inventory gets low. We’ll also deal with theft and returns.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Art Box is designed to blend in to any style property. As a humble crate, it won’t compete
              for attention with your decor. It’s designed to reward curiousity and as such there’s minimal
              marketing material. Guests browse the art, like they would a crate of vinyl records, self-checkout
              using a QR code on the back of each piece, and take home the art they buy.
