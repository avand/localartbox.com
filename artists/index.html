      Art Box exists to give talented artists that often struggle to self-promote or market their
      work an avenue to be rewarded for their creativity and share their talents with the world.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our network of Art Boxes are located in vacation rentals, hotels, cafes, and other areas
      where people have time to browse, enjoy, and shop for art in a relaxed and comfortable way.
      Art Box locations are not prone to theft, ensuring that artwork remains safe while being
      displayed to potential buyers.

      When and how do artists get paid?
    </h2>

    <p>
      Artists are paid quarterly. After credit card processing fees are removed from gross sales,
      artists keep 30% of the net sales. Disbursements are made via Venmo.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is also possible with increased sales volume that Art Box may offer to an artists work
      in bulk.
    </p>

    <h2 class="ab-heading mt-3 mb-2">
      What about theft?
    </h2>

    <p>
      Art Boxes are located in secure areas and theft is not common. However, it does happen.
      For art that is purchased in bulk, theft has no impact. Art Box will still be a net-positive
      revenue stream for artist even if theft occurs and continues to be an excellent way to
      promote an artist and their work.
