        Art Box exists to give talented artists that often struggle to self-promote or market their
        work an avenue to be rewarded for their creativity and share their talents with the world.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our network of Art Boxes are located in vacation rentals, hotels, cafes, and other areas
        where people have time to browse, enjoy, and shop for art in a relaxed and comfortable way.
        Art Box locations are not prone to theft, ensuring that artwork remains safe while being
        displayed to potential buyers.

        When and how do artists get paid?
      </p>

      <p>
        Artists are paid monthly. After credit card processing fees are removed from gross sales,
        artists keep 60% of the net sales. Disbursements are made via Venmo.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is also possible with increased sales volume that Art Box may offer to an artists work
        in bulk.
      </p>

      <p class="fw-bold">
        What about theft?
      </p>

      <p>
        Art Boxes are located in secure areas and theft is not common. However, it does happen.
        For art that is purchased in bulk, theft has no impact. Art Box will still be a net-positive
        revenue stream for artist even if theft occurs and continues to be an excellent way to
        promote an artist and their work.
